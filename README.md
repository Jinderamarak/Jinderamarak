### Hi guys

😍 My favorite things are **Typescript** and **React** but I can also speak in other languages like Java or C#.

🤩 I would like to learn Web Assembly and more about Cloud development in the near future!

👨‍🎓 I'm still a student so don't hesitate to tell me about my errors!

🙃 You can reach me on Twitter [@jinderamarak](https://twitter.com/jinderamarak) or Discord [Jinderamarak#2761](https://discord.com/users/227505701344378880) and don't forget to check my portfolio with my projects because I spent too much time on it 😡 [moravec.dev](https://moravec.dev)
